Does Silver Smell?<br>
Tip: Does Silver Smell? Written by Jenny and Rene Venegas It is rumored that silver has <br>
a distinct smell. Yes, yes it is true. Sterling or fine silver generally does not have a smell. <br>
Sometimes, there is a “sweet”-like smell to it.  Silver plated tends to smell rancid. If you are not <br>
sure of the smell, tub the silver item in your hand, <br>
specifically your psalm. Then smell your palms. If they smell pungent or <br>rancid, your item is more than likely <br>
not sterling or fine silver. <br>
Find Rene and Jenny’s jewelry and more in the store.  Rene also teaches […]

Earth Day Awareness “Textile Waste”
Tip: Earth Day Awareness “Textile Waste” Written by Roxanne <br>
Vigos of Star and Branch Every Earth Day we try to come up with <br>
better solutions for the enormous pollution and waste on planet Earth.<br>
 A great way to make an impact is by mindfully recycling textiles. <br>
 You can order a Take back bag from Four Days and it’s <br>
 one way to recycle clothing that is past a wearable state. <br>
 Other options include donating clothing that is in good <br>
 wearable condition to a charity or thrift store. <br>
 Often though we have clothing that is no longer suitable to<br>
  wear, here are some […]<br>


Ideas to Help Improve Your Art
Tip: How to Improve Your Art Written by Heather Musante <br>
How to Improve Your Art Many people will tell you the <br>
only way to improve is practice, practice, practice.  <br>
This is only partially true.  You also need to <br>
have a process of analyzing what you’ve done, <br>
to know how to improve your art and where to focus your efforts. 0)<br>

 fixed later on once you’ve learned more skills. 1)<br>

Drawing Spring Flowers
Tip: Drawing Spring Flowers Written by KC Peek from Seeds of Imagination <br>
The frenzy of spring is upon us! The flowers are so beautiful and you’d <br>
love to draw or paint them, but there are so many other things<br>
 taking priority… Snap a picture. Then in the dreary <br>
 winter months when you have more time, you can pull out the <br>
 image and create to your heart’s content. <br>
 One more tip… When you do pull out that picture<br>
  to draw or paint from, make sure you are drawing what you <br>
  actually see in the picture and not what you think you […]<br>

How to Draw<br>
Tip: How to Draw  Written by Lazann Eilander #1 Draw…You can’t draw if you don’t draw. <br>
I try to draw 15 minutes every day, I actually have a small notepad and pencil in my purse for <br>
those moments I have to wait on others in my life. I draw instead of being on the phone.<br>
 #2 You won’t like everything you draw, especially at first. Allow yourself to be “bad”<br>
